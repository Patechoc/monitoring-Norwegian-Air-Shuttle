# Tracking Norwegian Air Shuttle Prices... and more

The objective is to track data about flights with [Norwegian Air Shuttle](http://www.norwegian.no/) to discover trends on prices over time for the same flight, and later actual delays on each flight to analyze daily/yearly behaviors.

This app uses import.io to extract the data per day, only for one-way direct flights. 


## Usage

For now, pretty limited proof-of-concept:

´´´shell
python script_extractor_NorwegianAirShuttle_oneDay_oneWayDirect.py
´´´
